My name is Yajan Agarwal and recently I have completed my courses on coursera of Deep Face Recognition Model .
I got to learn new things which are really helpful for me. 
First I saw all the lecture videos and then I tried out the quizzes and the assignment which was being there for our practice.
Those assignment gave me a clarity about the topic like how we use different filters to go deep in an image and what are the differnt processe for that.
All those assignments were interlinked with each other and step by step I got to know the whole procedure which was really intersting.
Here I also got to know about the importance of triplet loss that we calculate.
